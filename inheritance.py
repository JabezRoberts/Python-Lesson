# CLASS INHERITANCE EXPLAINED:
# You can inherit methods and behaviors from an existing class. This is class inheritance.

# class Fish(Animal): # Fish inherists from the animal class
#     def __init__(self):
#         super().__init__() # Fish gets its attributes and methods from the animal class
